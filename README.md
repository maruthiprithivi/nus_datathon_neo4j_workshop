# NUS Datathon Neo4j Workshop - Follow Along Guide

This repository contains the Cypher queries to follow along with the workshop demo. These queries are in place to give you ideas around how working and exploring graph data feels and aim to pike your interests and get you to build on top of what you have picked up in this session.

For this demo we're going to use a data from [KEGG Disease Database](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/disease/) was used. The demo covers the following areas:

- Data Ingestion
- Data Exploration
- Connected Data Exploration
- Graph Exploration using Bloom

This demo was prepared following a great blog post on medium with the title [Neo4j for Diseases](https://towardsdatascience.com/neo4j-for-diseases-959dffb5b479) written by [Dr.Sixing Huang](https://dgg32.medium.com/), an avid Neo4j Community member. Do check out the blog post .It gives us a new perspective of how context-driven data analysis helps us understand data and uncover insights that we usually overlook due to how we traditionally design the data model in our RDBMS realm.

The tool required to run this will be a Neo4j Database with Neo4j Browser, and APOC queries tied to it. You can pick one of the following options to get yourself a running Neo4j Database for free:

- [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/)
